//session storage??

// session is a period when user starts an chrome tab and ends the period in between 

//session storage does not send to the server unlike coockies

// in cookies we can store 4000byte of data

// in session storage we can store at least 5MB of data;

// localStorage and session storage are the same the difference is it does not erraze automatically

//localstrorage has the hightest memory capacity as compaired to session storage and cookies

// the memory capacity depends on the what kind of device or the brower the user is using same at least 5 5MB

// we can use localstrorage or sessionstorage to store the user data such as preference and selected or browsed cities products etc
